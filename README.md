# too-human-names-generator
A cool set of simple text files and python scripts to generate the wonderful sounding item and monster names from the critically acclaimed XBOX 360 game Too Human

## How use?

Make sure everything is in the sme folder and your CMD / Terminal / Windows Terminal or what have you is also in that folder. Run the Python files with a ```python .\Item-gen.py``` or ```python .\enemy1-gen.py``` or ```python .\enemy2-gen.py```

I'll be adding more strings and robustness to this over time but for now this could be interesting.
